VIM Shortcuts:

    1. VIM MACRO to Put all function headers at the top of a file
           makyyggP`a]] 
       ma   - Record a macro in a register 'a'
       kyy  - Go one line above and copy the line
       ggP  - Go to the top of file and paste it
       `a   - Go back to line where we are left
       ]]   - Go to the next Brance in the 0th position

    2. Find which VIMRC file is loaded
           :echo $MYVIMRC

    3. Search for a line containing two words
           :set magic 
       /foo.*bar

       The 'magic' setting determines how VIM treats special characters in regular expressions.
       When it's off VIM treats all chars literally, meaning that the expression you wrote foo.*bar will actually search for that string.
       However, when 'magic' is on then special regex chars get their special meaning and it works more like you expect.

            *
            #

    24. If you don't want to search for the exact word
            g*
            g#


    25. Vertical Split

STACKOVERFLOW:
G100kdgg - delete last but 100 lines
Gdgg - delte entire file
dG - if in the first line of the file

: % y + - Select all
FufFile
 ~
    Toggle case of the character under the cursor, or all visually-selected characters. 

3~
    Toggle case of the next three characters. 

g~3w
    Toggle case of the next three words. 

g~iw
    Toggle case of the current word (inner word – cursor anywhere in word). 

g~$
    Toggle case of all characters to end of line. 

g~~
    Toggle case of the current line (same as V~). 

The above uses ~ to toggle case. In each example, you can replace ~ with u to convert to lowercase, or with U to convert to uppercase. For example:

U
    Uppercase the visually-selected text. 
    First press v or V then move to select text. 
    If you don't select text, pressing U will undo all changes to the current line. 

gUU
    Change the current line to uppercase (same as VU). 

gUiw
    Change current word to uppercase. 

g~3w
    Toggle case of the next three words. 

g~iw
    Toggle case of the current word (inner word – cursor anywhere in word). 

g~$
    Toggle case of all characters to end of line. 

g~~
    Toggle case of the current line (same as V~). 

u
    Lowercase the visually-selected text. 
    If you don't select text, pressing u will undo the last change. 

guu
    Change the current line to lowercase (same as Vu). 

Title Casing:: Capitalize first letter of each word:
s/\<./\u&/g
    \< matches the start of a word
    . matches the first character of a word
    \u tells Vim to uppercase the following character in the substitution string (&)
    & means substitute whatever was matched on the LHS


Search and Replace from current line
.,$s/user/device/gc

Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first. 
:%s/foo/bar/gc

Count number of matches of a pattern:
:%s/pattern//gn

Increment a number:
k^yWjP^<ctrl-a>j

    W - 
    y'a - Keeping Marks.
     A mark is set to any cursor location using the m command. Each mark is designated by a single lower case letter. Thus ma sets the 'a' mark to the current location, and mz sets the 'z' mark. You can move to the line containing a mark using the ' (single quote) command. Thus 'a moves to the beginning of the line containing the 'a' mark. You can move to the precise location of any mark using the ` (backquote) command. Thus `z will move directly to the exact location of the 'z' mark.

    { - beginning of a para
    } - end of a para
    d/foo - cut from current line till where foo is present
    ? - search backwards
    y?foo - copy from current line to most recent (previous) occurence of foo
    :127,215 s/foo/bar

    :% is synonymous with :1,$ (all the lines).
    :.,+21g/foo/d -  "delete any lines containing the string "foo" from the current one through the next 21 lines"
    :.,$v/bar/d - "from here to the end of the file, delete any lines which DON'T contain the string "bar."
    :% g/foo/m$ - all the "foo" lines will have been moved to the end of the file.
    :% g/^   /-1j - for every matching line, go up one line and join them).
    :% g/foo/s/bar/zzz/g -- for every line containing "foo" substitute all "bar" with "zzz."
    :'a,'bg/foo/j - join any line containing the string foo to its subsequent line, if it lies between the lines between the 'a' and 'b' marks.
    :r foo - Read the contents of file FOO and put it here
    IMP - More powerful is the :r! command. This reads the results of a command. It's the same as suspending the vi session, running a command, redirecting its output to a temporary file, resuming your vi session, and reading in the contents from the temp. file.
    ! - This we can sort all the lines in our file using 1G!Gsort (G is the vi "goto" command; it defaults to going to the last line of the file, but can be prefixed by a line number, such as 1, the first line). This is equivalent to the ex variant :1,$!sort
    {!}fmt (reformat the current paragraph).

    For example I have a seven line file (36 characters) which runs a file through wc, and inserts a C-style comment at the top of the file containing that word count data. I can apply that "macro" to a file by using a command like: vim +'so mymacro.ex' ./mytarget

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1632113/what-is-the-difference-between-sed-and-awk
1) What is the difference between awk and sed ?

Both are tools that transform text. BUT awk can do more things besides just manipulating text. Its a programming language by itself with most of the things you learn in programming, like arrays, loops, if/else flow control etc You can "program" in sed as well, but you won't want to maintain the code written in it.

2) What kind of application are best use cases for sed and awk tools ?

Conclusion: Use sed for very simple text parsing. Anything beyond that, awk is better. In fact, you can ditch sed altogether and just use awk. Since their functions overlap and awk can do more, just use awk. You will reduce your learning curve as well.

For BSD or GNU grep you can use -B num to set how many lines before the match and -A num for the number of lines after the match.
grep -B 3 -A 2 foo README.txt
If you want the same number of lines before and after you can use -C num.
grep -C 3 foo README.txt

Differences between grep, pgrep, egrep, and fgrep (Linux):
grep

grep is an acronym that stands for "Global Regular Expressions Print". grep is a program which scans a specified file or files line by line, returning lines that contain a pattern. A pattern is an expression that specifies a set of strings by interpreting characters as meta-characters. For example the asterisk meta character (*) is interpreted as meaning "zero or more of the preceding element". This enables users to type a short series of characters and meta characters into a grep command to have the computer show us what lines in which files match.

The standard grep command looks like:

grep <flags> '<regular expression>' <filename>

grep prints the search results to the screen (stdout) and returns the following exit values:

0    A match was found.
1    No match was found.
>1   A syntax error was found or a file was inaccessible 
     (even if matches were found).

Some common flags are: -c for counting the number of successful matches and not printing the actual matches, -i to make the search case insensitive, -n to print the line number before each match printout, -v to take the complement of the regular expression (i.e. return the lines which don't match), and -l to print the file names of files with lines which match the expression.
egrep

egrep is an acronym that stands for "Extended Global Regular Expressions Print".

The 'E' in egrep means treat the pattern as a regular expression. "Extended Regular Expressions" abbreviated 'ERE' is enabled in egrep. egrep (which is the same as grep -E) treats +, ?, |, (, and ) as meta-characters.

In basic regular expressions (with grep), the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (, and ) lose their special meaning. If you want grep to treat these characters as meta-characters, escape them \?, \+, \{, \|, \(, and \).

For example, here grep uses basic regular expressions where the plus is treated literally, any line with a plus in it is returned.

grep "+" myfile.txt

egrep on the other hand treats the "+" as a meta character and returns every line because plus is interpreted as "one or more times".

egrep "+" myfile.txt

Here every line is returned because the + was treated by egrep as a meta character. normal grep would have searched only for lines with a literal +.
fgrep

fgrep is an acronym that stands for "Fixed-string Global Regular Expressions Print".

fgrep (which is the same as grep -F) is fixed or fast grep and behaves as grep but does NOT recognize any regular expression meta-characters as being special. The search will complete faster because it only processes a simple string rather than a complex pattern.

For example, if I wanted to search my .bash_profile for a literal dot (.) then using grep would be difficult because I would have to escape the dot because dot is a meta character that means 'wild-card, any single character':

grep "." myfile.txt

The above command returns every line of myfile.txt. Do this instead:

fgrep "." myfile.txt

Then only the lines that have a literal '.' in them are returned. fgrep helps us not bother escaping our meta characters.
pgrep

pgrep is an acronym that stands for "Process-ID Global Regular Expressions Print".

pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs which matches the selection criteria to stdout. pgrep is handy when all you want to know is the process id integer of a process. For example, if I wanted to know only the process ID of my mysql process I would use the command pgrep mysql which would return a process ID like 7312.

VIM:

To turn off autoindent when you paste code, there's a special "paste" mode.

									    Type

:set paste

Then paste your code. Note that the text in the tooltip now says -- INSERT (paste) --.

After you pasted your code, turn off the paste-mode, so that auto-indenting when you type works correctly again.

:set nopaste

ctrl+o - preivous cursor positions
ctrl+i - next cursor postions
ctrl+V - Select a specific column of text
:.,$s/access_based_enumeration/namespace_cachin/gc
:s/fake-open/search-short-names/gc
s/a/X/ will return => Xbcabc
s/a/X/g will return => XbcXbc


:diffthis - enter this on both the files that are opened in vertical view. It will show the diff
:set scrollbind - to scroll two views together
:set noscrollbind - to unbind the above
:diffoff

w!
p4 edit file name
then :load file name

    "kyy
Or you can append to a register by using a capital letter
    "Kyy
You can then move through the document and paste it elsewhere using
    "kp

VIM DIFF:
do - Get changes from other window into the current window.

dp - Put the changes from current window into the other window.

]c - Jump to the next change.

[c - Jump to the previous change.

Ctrl W + w - Switch to the other split window (CTRL-W CTRL-W does the same
thing, in case you let go of the CTRL key a bit later)

List only directories:
    ls -d */

List only hidden files
    ls -a | grep '^\.'

Macro:

    q indicates to start the recording
    a indicates to store the recordings in register a
    When you do q a, it will display “recording” at the bottom of the vi.

:reg
In vim, the macros are just stored in registers. You can recall the content of any register and execute it as a macro (which is what the @ does). To see a list of what is in your registers, use :reg.

Delete a specific set of lines (Lines that do not have a number in it)
VIM: Match patterns
g!/^[0-9]/d

For example, to delete all lines containing "profile" (remove the /d to show the lines that the command will delete):
:g/profile/d
:g/pikki/d


See command history:
q:

Stop the recording

Type: q

@a repeats the macro “a” one time.

:sort - sorts all lines in the file

The following command will sort all lines and remove duplicates (keeping unique lines):
:sort u


Recursive Macro:
    qa@aq

    ex:

    qa0gUwj@aq


Vim highlight a list of words OR Highlight multiple words
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2666
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Highlight_multiple_words

    You could use the :match command.
    :match Todo /word1/

    The first parameter of the command is the highlight-group (to see all available groups :highlight). The second parameter is a search pattern.

    You can put these in any file and load it via :source.

    Another way is to change the regular expression (thx @zpon):

    :match Todo /word1\|word2\|word3/

    If you want to highlight them differently:

    :match Todo /word1/
    :2match Error /word2/
    :3match Title /word3/

TMUX Session:
https://gist.github.com/henrik/1967800
https://gist.github.com/andreyvit/2921703

$ tmux ls
$ tmux kill-session -t 0
$ tmux new -s myname
tmux a  #  (or at, or attach)
tmux a -t myname

prefix + d - detaches and goes back to putty

Scroll:
Ctrl-b then [ then you can use your normal navigation keys to scroll around (eg. Up Arrow or PgDn). Press q to quit scroll mode.
Alternatively you can press Ctrl-b PgUp to go directly into copy mode and scroll one page up (which is what it sounds like you will want most of the time)
You can also scroll up/down line by line using Shift-k and Shift-j (if you're already in scroll mode).

VERY IMP:
Ctrl-b [ - takes you to TMUX mode. And then you can do your VIM scrolling


:new<CR>  new session
s  list sessions
$  name session

`tmux rename-window (prefix + ,)`


`tmux split-window (prefix + %)`
    splits the window into two vertical panes

`tmux split-window -h (prefix + ")`
    splits the window into two horizontal panes

`tmux swap-pane -[UDLR] (prefix + { or })`
    swaps pane with another in the specified direction

`tmux select-pane -[UDLR]`
    selects the next pane in the specified direction

`tmux select-pane -t :.+`
    selects the next pane in numerical order 

^b then x to kill the current pane (or window if it only has one pane)

^b then [ to enter copy mode, then four arrow keys to move, even past the visible point, which is great for scrolling--I don't use it much for copying/pasting.

C-a &          kill the current window

C-a p          previous window
C-a n          next window
C-a l          ‘last’ (previously used) window
C-a w          choose window from a list

Before pasting into the terminal, try :set paste (and then :set nopaste after you're done). This will turn off the auto-indent, line-wrap, etc. features that are messing up your paste.
